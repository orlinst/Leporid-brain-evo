Significant
 (PGLS)
 - No effect of seasonality on total relative brain size at all
 - no individual effect of seasonality (T & P) on relative OB volume 
 - BUT interactive effect of both measures of T & P on OB (negative) (L = 0.646) ************
 - relative OB volume increases with gestation length (L = 0.853)	*************						 
 - No effect of GR area on volume at all
 - total and OB relative brain size is lower in nocturnal rabbits than non-nocturnal (check lambda)


 (aov.phylo) - check lambda!
 - total and OB relative brain size is lower in nocturnal rabbits than non-nocturnal
 - No effect of locomoter mode on relative brain size at all
 - No effect of diet breadth on relative brain size at all
 - No effect of burrowing on relative brain size at all


 (Vera's models)
 - Significant effect in GR area on relative OB volume in environmental interaction (Activity + burrow + locomotor + diet + home range)
 - No effect of maternal investment model at all (litter size + gestion length)


 # Really understand the meaning of asterisk, semicolon, and plus
 # We used these differently to get A) significant results and B) significant lambda
 # Figure out how to report differences between vera's models and our simple models
