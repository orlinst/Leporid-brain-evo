Total brain ~ GR total : Home range mostly driven by Home Range
but not OB

Locomotor_Mode - Saltatorial

(Including body mass)



OB ~ Temp mean + Precip mean (body mass)


Yearly vs century seasonality
two trees

GR_Area vs Seasonality (OB vs T)


ECV_T - Total endocranial volume
ECV_OB - ... olfactory bulb
ECV_ROB - ... rest of brain


GR_Area - Geographic range area

Se_temp - temperature seasonality
Se_precip - precipitation seasonality

ST - seasonality temperature
